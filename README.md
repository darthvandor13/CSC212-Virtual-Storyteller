# **How Our AI Storytelling Robot Works – ChatGPT Version (Explained for Everyone) :) **

Imagine a robot storyteller that listens to you, understands what kind of story you want, and then tells you an engaging, AI-generated tale—all in real-time. Our project is about making that happen using a humanoid robot (NAO), AI storytelling technology (ChatGPT), and a system that connects them.

## **How It Works**

### **🔹 Step 1: The User Talks to the Robot**

The interaction starts when a person speaks to the NAO robot—just like talking to a smart assistant (e.g., Siri, Alexa). They might say:

🗣️ *“Tell me a story about a brave astronaut!”*

#### **🔹 What Happens Next?**

- The robot listens using its built-in microphone.
- The speech is converted into text (so the AI can understand it).
- The request is sent to our AI-powered storytelling system for processing.

### **🔹 Step 2: Processing the Story Request**

Once the user’s request is received, the system figures out what kind of story to generate.

#### **🔹 How It Works Behind the Scenes:**

- The request is sent to ChatGPT, an advanced AI model that can generate human-like text.
- ChatGPT creates a unique story based on the input.
- The AI structures the story so it makes sense, ensuring it’s engaging and fun.
- The finished story is sent back to the robot to be spoken aloud.

#### **🔹 For Example:**

If the user asked for a space adventure, ChatGPT might generate a story about: 🚀 *“Captain Luna, a brave astronaut, who embarks on a journey to find a lost alien civilization.”*

### **🔹 Step 3: The Robot Tells the Story**

Now that the story has been created, the robot brings it to life!

#### **🔹 What Happens Now?**

- The AI-generated story is converted back into speech using the robot’s built-in voice.
- The robot reads the story aloud, just like a human storyteller would.
- If time allows, we might also make the robot move its arms, nod, or react during the story.

### **🔹 Step 4: User Interaction (Optional Future Feature)**

Instead of just telling one long story, the system could allow for interactive choices, where the listener gets to decide what happens next.

#### **🔹 For Example:**

🗣️ *"Should Captain Luna explore the dark cave or send a drone first?"* 🤖 The robot waits for an answer and then continues the story based on the choice.

*(This would take extra time to implement, so we may stick to straightforward storytelling for now!)*

### **🔹 What’s Needed to Make This Work?**

Building this system requires connecting three main components: 1️⃣ **The NAO Robot** – The physical device that listens, speaks, and interacts. 2️⃣ **Dialogflow CX** – A system that helps manage the conversation flow and decides what should happen next. 3️⃣ **ChatGPT API** – The AI that generates the actual story.

To make them work together, we need a **bridge**—a small program called a **webhook** that connects Dialogflow CX to ChatGPT.

### **🔹 How Long Will This Take?**

Since we’re working under a deadline, we’re focusing on the core goal: ✅ Make the robot listen, generate, and tell a story smoothly. 🚀 If time allows, we’ll explore adding extra features, like gestures or interactive choices.

### **🔹 Why This Matters**

This AI-powered storytelling system could be useful for **educators, therapists, and caregivers**, helping them introduce engaging, AI-generated stories in an interactive way. It also provides a hands-free, voice-activated experience, making it easy to use.

While this is a technical research project, it’s also about **bringing storytelling to life** using AI and robotics!

### **🔹 Summary: The Big Picture**

🔹 User speaks to the robot → 🗣️ NAO listens\
🔹 Request is sent to ChatGPT → 💡 AI generates a unique story\
🔹 Story is sent back to the robot → 🤖 NAO reads the story aloud\
🔹 Potential future expansion → 🔄 Interactive choices

# **How Our AI Storytelling System Works – ChatGPT Version (Explained for a CS Student)**

This project is about integrating **robotics and AI** to create an interactive storytelling system where a humanoid robot (NAO) listens to user input, processes the request using AI (ChatGPT), and narrates a dynamically generated story.

### **🔹 Core Components:**

- **NAO Robot** → Captures voice input and outputs speech.
- **Dialogflow CX** → Manages the conversation and processes user input.
- **ChatGPT API** → Generates the story dynamically based on user preferences.

A **webhook** is developed to **bridge** Dialogflow CX and ChatGPT.

## **System Breakdown**

### **🔹 Step 1: User Input & Speech Processing**

The interaction begins when the user talks to NAO:

🗣️ *Example: “Tell me a story about a brave astronaut.”*

#### **🔹 How This Works Technically:**

1. NAO records the user’s voice and converts speech to text.
2. The text is sent to Dialogflow CX, which classifies the intent (e.g., “Story Request”) and extracts parameters (e.g., “astronaut theme”).
3. Dialogflow forwards this request to our custom webhook, which will call ChatGPT.

### **🔹 Step 2: Webhook & AI Story Generation**

The webhook is a simple backend service (**Python/Flask** or **Node.js**) that processes Dialogflow’s structured request and queries **ChatGPT’s API**.

#### **🔹 Technical Breakdown:**

- Webhook receives a **JSON request** from Dialogflow CX.
- Extracts the user’s theme preference (e.g., *“astronaut adventure”*).
- Formats the request and sends it to **ChatGPT’s API**.
- ChatGPT generates a structured response, returning a **short story**.
- Webhook parses the response and sends it back to Dialogflow CX.

#### **💡 Example API Call to ChatGPT:**

```python
import openai

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "Tell a short astronaut adventure story."}]
)
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

### **🔹 Step 3: NAO Reads the Story Aloud**

Once the AI-generated story is returned, it’s sent back to **NAO for speech synthesis**.

#### **🔹 How This Works:**

- The **formatted story text** is sent back to **Dialogflow CX**.
- Dialogflow forwards the response to **NAO**.
- NAO’s **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** engine converts the text to spoken words.

#### **💡 Example NAO TTS Code:**

```python
from naoqi import ALProxy

tts = ALProxy("ALTextToSpeech", "<NAO_IP>", 9559)
story_text = "Captain Luna soared through space on a mission to find the lost alien civilization."
tts.say(story_text)
```

### **🔹 Summary of the System Flow:**

1️⃣ **User speaks to NAO** → Speech converted to text\
2️⃣ **Dialogflow CX processes request** → Extracts story parameters\
3️⃣ **Webhook sends request to ChatGPT** → AI generates a custom story\
4️⃣ **Webhook returns the story to Dialogflow CX**\
5️⃣ **NAO reads the story aloud using TTS**

This setup ensures seamless **AI-powered storytelling**, bridging **speech recognition, NLP, and robotics** in a meaningful way. 🚀
