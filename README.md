# NAO Virtual Storyteller ‚Äî Research Project

## Abstract
This research project explores the feasibility of integrating generative AI with the NAO humanoid robot to create a virtual storyteller designed for caregivers, educators, and professionals in assistive and therapeutic fields. Studies indicate that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often find robots more approachable and predictable than human partners, making robotic interaction a valuable tool for fostering communication and social skills. By leveraging the NAO robot‚Äôs built-in audio functionality as the primary mode of interaction, this project examines how robotics and generative AI can enhance interactive storytelling.

The system implementation will utilize Google Dialogflow CX to manage conversational flow and process user input, working in conjunction with a Conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CoRAG) model. CoRAG enhances storytelling continuity by adapting to user choices and thematic preferences over multiple interactions. Instead of generating isolated responses, CoRAG enables the storyteller to retain user preferences and past interactions, ensuring context-aware, progressively enriching narratives. The storyteller will process verbal input‚Äîsuch as user choices, questions, and themes‚Äîto generate personalized stories set in engaging fictional worlds, including space adventures and fantasy realms.

Caregivers, educators, and professionals working with ASD may benefit from NAO-integrated storytelling as a tool for engagement and guided learning. By leveraging CoRAG, we aim to develop an accessible and contextually adaptive storytelling platform that fosters meaningful interaction within caregiver-supported environments. Looking ahead, we envision a future where the NAO robot‚Äôs mechanical expressiveness further enhances the storytelling experience through emotionally expressive movements, deepening engagement and immersion.

## How Our AI Storytelling Robot Works ‚Äì ChatGPT Version (Explained for Everyone) :)

Imagine a robot storyteller that listens to you, understands what kind of story you want, and then tells you an engaging, AI-generated tale‚Äîall in real-time. Our project is about making that happen using a humanoid robot (NAO), AI storytelling technology (ChatGPT), and a system that connects them.

### üîπ Step 1: The User Talks to the Robot
The interaction starts when a person speaks to the NAO robot‚Äîjust like talking to a smart assistant (e.g., Siri, Alexa). They might say:

üó£Ô∏è *‚ÄúTell me a story about a brave astronaut!‚Äù*

#### üîπ What Happens Next?
- The robot listens using its built-in microphone.  
- The speech is converted into text (so the AI can understand it).  
- The request is sent to our AI-powered storytelling system for processing.  

### üîπ Step 2: Processing the Story Request
Once the user‚Äôs request is received, the system figures out what kind of story to generate.

#### üîπ How It Works Behind the Scenes:
- The request is sent to ChatGPT, an advanced AI model that can generate human-like text.  
- ChatGPT creates a unique story based on the input.  
- The AI structures the story so it makes sense, ensuring it‚Äôs engaging and fun.  
- The finished story is sent back to the robot to be spoken aloud.  

#### üîπ For Example:
If the user asked for a space adventure, ChatGPT might generate a story about: üöÄ *‚ÄúCaptain Luna, a brave astronaut, who embarks on a journey to find a lost alien civilization.‚Äù*

### üîπ Step 3: The Robot Tells the Story
Now that the story has been created, the robot brings it to life!

#### üîπ What Happens Now?
- The AI-generated story is converted back into speech using the robot‚Äôs built-in voice.  
- The robot reads the story aloud, just like a human storyteller would.  
- If time allows, we might also make the robot move its arms, nod, or react during the story.  

### üîπ Step 4: User Interaction (Optional Future Feature)
Instead of just telling one long story, the system could allow for interactive choices, where the listener gets to decide what happens next.

#### üîπ For Example:
üó£Ô∏è *"Should Captain Luna explore the dark cave or send a drone first?"* ü§ñ The robot waits for an answer and then continues the story based on the choice.

*(This would take extra time to implement, so we may stick to straightforward storytelling for now!)*

### üîπ What‚Äôs Needed to Make This Work?
Building this system requires connecting three main components:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **The NAO Robot** ‚Äì The physical device that listens, speaks, and interacts.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Conversational Agents (Dialogflow CX)** ‚Äì A system that helps manage the conversation flow and decides what should happen next.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **ChatGPT API** ‚Äì The AI that generates the actual story.  

To make them work together, we need a **bridge**‚Äîa small program called a **webhook** that connects Conversational Agents (Dialogflow CX) to ChatGPT.

### üîπ How Long Will This Take?
Since we‚Äôre working under a deadline, we‚Äôre focusing on the core goal: ‚úÖ Make the robot listen, generate, and tell a story smoothly. üöÄ If time allows, we‚Äôll explore adding extra features, like gestures or interactive choices.

### üîπ Why This Matters
This AI-powered storytelling system could be useful for **educators, therapists, and caregivers**, helping them introduce engaging, AI-generated stories in an interactive way. It also provides a hands-free, voice-activated experience, making it easy to use.

While this is a technical research project, it‚Äôs also about **bringing storytelling to life** using AI and robotics!

### üîπ Summary: The Big Picture
üîπ User speaks to the robot ‚Üí üó£Ô∏è NAO listens  
üîπ Request is sent to ChatGPT ‚Üí üí° AI generates a unique story  
üîπ Story is sent back to the robot ‚Üí ü§ñ NAO reads the story aloud  
üîπ Potential future expansion ‚Üí üîÑ Interactive choices

## How Our AI Storytelling System Works ‚Äì ChatGPT Version (Explained for a CS Student)

This project is about integrating **robotics and AI** to create an interactive storytelling system where a humanoid robot (NAO) listens to user input, processes the request using AI (ChatGPT), and narrates a dynamically generated story.

### üîπ Core Components:
- **NAO Robot** ‚Üí Captures voice input and outputs speech.  
- **Conversational Agents (Dialogflow CX)** ‚Üí Manages the conversation and processes user input.  
- **ChatGPT API** ‚Üí Generates the story dynamically based on user preferences.  

A **webhook** is developed to **bridge** Conversational Agents (Dialogflow CX) and ChatGPT.

### üîπ Step 1: User Input & Speech Processing
The interaction begins when the user talks to NAO:

üó£Ô∏è *Example: ‚ÄúTell me a story about a brave astronaut.‚Äù*

#### üîπ How This Works Technically:
1. NAO records the user‚Äôs voice and converts speech to text.  
2. The text is sent to Conversational Agents (Dialogflow CX), which classifies the intent (e.g., ‚ÄúStory Request‚Äù) and extracts parameters (e.g., ‚Äúastronaut theme‚Äù).  
3. Conversational Agents (Dialogflow CX) forwards this request to our custom webhook, which will call ChatGPT.

### üîπ Step 2: Webhook & AI Story Generation
The webhook is a simple backend service (**Python/Flask** or **Node.js**) that processes Conversational Agents' (Dialogflow CX) structured request and queries **ChatGPT‚Äôs API**.

#### üîπ Technical Breakdown:
- Webhook receives a **JSON request** from Conversational Agents (Dialogflow CX).  
- Extracts the user‚Äôs theme preference (e.g., ‚Äúastronaut adventure‚Äù).  
- Formats the request and sends it to **ChatGPT‚Äôs API**.  
- ChatGPT generates a structured response, returning a **short story**.  
- Webhook parses the response and sends it back to **Dialogflow CX**.

##### Example API Call to ChatGPT
```python
import openai

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "Tell a short astronaut adventure story."}]
)
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

### üîπ Step 3: NAO Reads the Story Aloud
Once the AI-generated story is returned, it‚Äôs sent back to **NAO for speech synthesis**.

#### üîπ How This Works:
- The **formatted story text** is sent back to **Conversational Agents (Dialogflow CX)**.  
- Conversational Agents (Dialogflow CX) forwards the response to **NAO**.  
- NAO‚Äôs **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** engine converts the text to spoken words.

##### Example NAO TTS Code
```python
from naoqi import ALProxy

tts = ALProxy("ALTextToSpeech", "<NAO_IP>", 9559)
story_text = "Captain Luna soared through space on a mission to find the lost alien civilization."
tts.say(story_text)
```

### üîπ Summary of the System Flow:
üîπ **User speaks to NAO** ‚Üí Speech converted to text  
üîπ **Conversational Agents (Dialogflow CX) processes request** ‚Üí Extracts story parameters  
üîπ **Webhook sends request to ChatGPT** ‚Üí AI generates a custom story  
üîπ **Webhook returns the story to Conversational Agents (Dialogflow CX)** üîπ **NAO reads the story aloud** using TTS

# NAO Virtual Storyteller: Project Setup & Guide

## Project Objective

This project demonstrates a **proof of concept** where a **NAO robot** serves as the expressive medium for a **virtual storyteller**. The current core of the storytelling logic resides within a **Google Cloud Dialogflow CX agent**, which uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a GCS Data Store.

Earlier iterations and proof-of-concept scripts explored direct NAO interaction with local webhooks and vector databases (like ChromaDB). These scripts, primarily for Python 2 and NAOqi interaction, are included in this repository for completeness, testing, and to showcase the project's evolution.

This README provides setup instructions for both:
1.  The **NAO robot interaction components** (requiring Python 2.7 and the NAOqi SDK).
2.  The **Dialogflow CX AI Storyteller Agent** (requiring Google Cloud Platform setup).

## Section 1: NAO Robot Interaction Setup (Python 2 & NAOqi SDK)

This section details setting up your Ubuntu 22.04 system to run the Python 2 scripts that interact directly with the NAO robot.

### 1.1. Network Setup for NAO Robot

For your computer to communicate with the NAO robot, both must be on the same network.

#### 1.1.1. Connect NAO to the Network
* **Wi-Fi:** You can configure Wi-Fi on your NAO by connecting to its embedded web page. When NAO starts, it may announce its IP address or create its own Wi-Fi hotspot for initial configuration. Refer to your NAO's documentation for specific instructions.
* **Ethernet:** Connect an Ethernet cable from the NAO to your router or network switch.

#### 1.1.2. Find NAO's IP Address
* **Chest Button:** Press NAO's chest button once. It should say its IP address.
* **Router's DHCP Client List:** Check your router's administration page for a list of connected devices and find the NAO's IP address.
* **Network Scanning Tools:** Tools like `nmap` (e.g., `nmap -sP YOUR_NETWORK_CIDR` like `192.168.1.0/24`) can help discover devices on your network.

#### 1.1.3. Ensure Network Connectivity
* Once you have NAO's IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.120`), try to ping it from your Ubuntu machine:
    ```bash
    ping YOUR_NAO_IP_ADDRESS
    ```
* Ensure your PC and NAO are on the same subnet.

#### 1.1.4. Firewall Considerations
* The NAOqi SDK typically communicates on port `9559`. Ensure that no firewall on your Ubuntu machine or network is blocking TCP traffic on this port to or from the NAO's IP address.
    * You can temporarily disable `ufw` (if active) for testing: `sudo ufw disable` (remember to re-enable it later with `sudo ufw enable` and configure rules if necessary).

### 1.2. Install Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 22.04 (using `pyenv`)

Ubuntu 22.04 does not include Python 2 by default. Using `pyenv` is a clean way to install and manage Python 2.7 without interfering with the system's Python 3.

#### 1.2.1. Install `pyenv` Dependencies
These packages are needed to compile Python versions with `pyenv`:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev     libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm     libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
```

#### 1.2.2. Install `pyenv`
The recommended way to install `pyenv` is using the `pyenv-installer`:
```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```
This script will also show you how to set up your shell environment for `pyenv`.

#### 1.2.3. Configure Shell for `pyenv`
After installation, add the following lines to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`):
```bash
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
  eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
  eval "$(pyenv init -)"
fi
```
Then, apply the changes by sourcing the file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`) or opening a new terminal session.

#### 1.2.4. Install Python 2.7.18 with `pyenv`
Python 2.7.18 was the final release of Python 2.
```bash
pyenv install 2.7.18
```
This might take some time as it compiles Python from source.

#### 1.2.5. (Optional) Set Python 2.7.18 as Local Default for Your Project
Navigate to your project directory (or the `naoqi_tests` subdirectory):
```bash
cd /path/to/your/nao_project # Or ./naoqi_tests
pyenv local 2.7.18
```
This creates a `.python-version` file, and `pyenv` will automatically use Python 2.7.18 here.

### 1.3. Create a Python 2 Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment. Let's name it `naoqi_env`.

#### 1.3.1. Ensure `pip` for Python 2.7 is Available
If `pyenv local 2.7.18` is active, `python` should point to Python 2.7.
Ensure `pip` is installed and up-to-date for this Python 2.7 version:
```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

#### 1.3.2. Install `virtualenv`
```bash
python -m pip install virtualenv
```

#### 1.3.3. Create and Activate the Virtual Environment
In your project directory (e.g., where `naoqi_tests` is located):
```bash
python -m virtualenv naoqi_env # Creates 'naoqi_env' folder
source naoqi_env/bin/activate   # Activates the environment
```
Your command prompt should now be prefixed with `(naoqi_env)`.

### 1.4. Install the NAOqi Python 2 SDK

This guide assumes you have downloaded the NAOqi Python 2 SDK for Linux (e.g., `pynaoqi-python2.7-X.X.X.X-linux64.tar.gz`).

#### 1.4.1. Extract the SDK
Extract the SDK archive to a known location, e.g., `~/naoqi_sdks/`.
The key library files (`naoqi.py`, `_naoqi.so`) are usually within a path like `pynaoqi-python2.7-X.X.X.X-linux64/lib/python2.7/site-packages/`.

#### 1.4.2. Make NAOqi SDK available to your Python 2 Environment
**Option A: Setting `PYTHONPATH` (Recommended)**
1.  Identify the full path to the SDK's `site-packages` directory (e.g., `~/naoqi_sdks/pynaoqi-python2.7-X.X.X.X-linux64/lib/python2.7/site-packages`). Let this be `NAOQI_PYTHON_LIB_DIR`.
2.  Add to your virtual environment's activation script:
    ```bash
    # (Ensure naoqi_env is activated)
    # (Replace /path/to/your/NAOQI_PYTHON_LIB_DIR with the actual, absolute path)
    echo 'export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/your/NAOQI_PYTHON_LIB_DIR"' >> naoqi_env/bin/activate
    ```
    Deactivate and reactivate (`deactivate`, then `source naoqi_env/bin/activate`).

**Option B: Copying SDK files into Virtual Environment**
1.  Activate `naoqi_env`.
2.  Copy `naoqi.py`, `_naoqi.so`, and other relevant files (e.g., `motion_definitions.py`) from the SDK's `site-packages` to `naoqi_env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/`.
    ```bash
    # Example (replace with your actual SDK path):
    # SDK_LIB_PATH="~/naoqi_sdks/pynaoqi-python2.7-X.X.X.X-linux64/lib/python2.7/site-packages"
    # VENV_LIB_PATH="naoqi_env/lib/python2.7/site-packages"
    # cp "${SDK_LIB_PATH}/naoqi.py" "${VENV_LIB_PATH}/"; cp "${SDK_LIB_PATH}/_naoqi.so" "${VENV_LIB_PATH}/"
    ```

#### 1.4.3. Test NAOqi Import
With `naoqi_env` activated:
```bash
python -c "import naoqi; print 'NAOqi SDK imported successfully!'"
```

### 1.5. Install Python 2 Dependencies for NAO Scripts
The `test_asr.py` script calls a webhook and needs `requests`:
```bash
# (Ensure 'naoqi_env' is activated)
pip install requests
```
If running `chatgpt_webhook.py` under Python 2 (not generally recommended for modern Flask/OpenAI usage), install Flask:
```bash
# pip install Flask
```

### 1.6. Troubleshooting NAO Setup
* **"ImportError: No module named naoqi"**: Check venv activation, `PYTHONPATH` (Option A) or file copy (Option B).
* **Connection Errors to NAO**: Verify IP, network, ping, firewall (port 9559 TCP).
* **SDK/OS Version:** Ensure NAOqi Python SDK and NAO's OS are compatible.

This section details the setup for the current core of the virtual storyteller, which uses Google Cloud Dialogflow CX with a GCS Data Store for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
*(This content is adapted from the README of the [ai-storyteller-agent-config](https://github.com/darthvandor13/ai-storyteller-agent-config) repository).*

### 2.1. Project Overview (Dialogflow CX Agent)

This component implements a conversational AI agent using **Google Cloud Dialogflow CX** designed to act as a virtual storyteller. The agent engages users in a conversation to gather preferences (protagonist name, story theme, moral) and then generates a unique short story (300-350 words).

The core mechanism is **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The agent retrieves relevant context snippets from a predefined knowledge base of stories (hosted in Google Cloud Storage) and uses these snippets, along with the user's parameters, as strict inspiration to generate a new, original story. It is explicitly instructed *not* to use external knowledge or copy directly from the source material.

*(**Note on Initial Approach:** An earlier iteration attempted using ChromaDB via a webhook and parameter presets. This approach was paused due to platform issues encountered with parameter preset handling ‚Äì specifically, the UI automatically adding quotes to `$webhookResponse` paths.)*

### 2.2. Technology Stack (Dialogflow CX Agent)

* **Conversational Platform:** Google Cloud Dialogflow CX
* **Knowledge Base Backend:** Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
* **Secrets Management:** Google Cloud Secret Manager
* **Version Control (for Agent Config):** GitHub (via Dialogflow CX Git Integration)

### 2.3. Core Concepts: RAG via GCS Data Store

1.  **Data Storage:** Source story texts (PDF, TXT, HTML formats supported) are stored in a GCS bucket.
2.  **Data Store Resource:** A Dialogflow "Data Store" resource is created within the Agent Builder environment, configured to point to the GCS bucket and index the unstructured content.
3.  **Data Store Tool:** A "Data Store Tool" is created within the agent and linked to the specific Data Store resource.
4.  **Retrieval:** The agent's playbook logic calls this Data Store Tool, sending a query based on user input.
5.  **Generation:** The tool returns relevant text snippets. These snippets, along with user parameters, are used within a generative prompt executed by the agent's playbook to create the final story.

### 2.4. Setup & Prerequisites (Dialogflow CX Start-to-Finish)

This guide assumes you have a Google Cloud project with billing enabled.

1.  **Enable APIs:**
    * In the Google Cloud Console, ensure the following APIs are enabled for your project:
        * Dialogflow API
        * Secret Manager API
        * Cloud Storage API
        * Vertex AI Agent Builder API (or Vertex AI Search and Conversation API)

2.  **Create GCS Bucket:**
    * Navigate to Cloud Storage -> Buckets. Click "Create".
    * Choose a unique **Bucket name** (e.g., `[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]-story-data`).
    * Select **Location type: Region** and choose the **SAME REGION** as your Dialogflow agent (e.g., `us-central1`). This is critical.
    * Select **Storage class: Standard**. Configure access control. Click "Create".

3.  **Upload Story Files:**
    * Upload your source story files (e.g., `.pdf`, `.txt`) to the GCS bucket.

4.  **Create GitHub Repository (for Agent Config Sync):**
    * Create a new, **dedicated repository** on GitHub (e.g., `ai-storyteller-agent-config`).
    * Ensure the primary branch (e.g., `main`) exists.

5.  **Create GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):**
    * In GitHub: Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Fine-grained tokens.
    * Click "Generate new token". Name it (e.g., `dialogflow-cx-sync`), set Expiration.
    * Under "Repository access", select **"Only select repositories"** and choose the repo from step 4.
    * Under "Permissions" -> "Repository permissions", find **"Contents"** and set access to **"Read and write"**.
    * Click "Generate token". **COPY THE TOKEN IMMEDIATELY.**

6.  **Store PAT in Secret Manager:**
    * In Google Cloud Console -> Security -> Secret Manager. Click "+ Create Secret".
    * Enter a **Name** (e.g., `github-dialogflow-pat`). Paste the PAT into **Secret value**. Click "Create Secret".

7.  **Grant Dialogflow Access to Secret:**
    * In Secret Manager, open the secret. Go to "Permissions" tab. Click "+ Grant Access".
    * **New principals:** `service-[YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER]@gcp-sa-dialogflow.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (Replace `[YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER]`).
    * **Assign roles:** `Secret Manager Secret Accessor`. Click "Save".

8.  **Grant Dialogflow Access to GCS Bucket:**
    * Navigate to your story data GCS Bucket -> "Permissions" tab. Click "+ Grant Access".
    * **New principals:** `service-[YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER]@gcp-sa-dialogflow.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
    * **Assign roles:** `Storage Object Viewer`. Click "Save".

### 2.5. Agent Configuration Steps (Dialogflow CX Console)

1.  **Create Agent (if needed):**
    * Create a new agent ("Build your own"). Specify Agent Name, **Location/Region** (must match GCS bucket), Time zone, Default language.

2.  **Create Data Store Resource:**
    * Go to "Data Stores". Click "Create new data store".
    * Source: **"Cloud Storage"**. Select your GCS bucket/folder.
    * Data type: **"Unstructured documents"**.
    * Sync frequency: **"One time"** (workaround for potential UI issues). Click "Continue".
    * **Configure data connector:** Location (e.g., `us (multi-region)` for agent in `us-central1`), unique Connector name. Click "Create".
    * Wait for indexing ("Data Ingestion Activity" should show "Succeeded").

3.  **Create Data Store Tool:**
    * Go to "Tools". Click "+ Create".
    * **Tool Name:** e.g., `WorkspaceStoryContextTool-OneTime`.
    * **Tool Type:** `Data store`.
    * **Data stores:** Add the data store created above.
    * Add a Description. Click "Save".

4.  **Configure GitHub Integration (in Agent Settings):**
    * Go to Agent Settings (‚öôÔ∏è icon) -> "Git integration". Click "+ Add Git integration".
    * **Display name:** e.g., `GitHub Sync - Storyteller Agent`.
    * **Git repository:** HTTPS URL of your dedicated GitHub repo for agent config.
    * **Branch:** e.g., `main`.
    * **Access token secret:** Full resource name of the Secret Manager secret version (e.g., `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/secrets/[SECRET_NAME]/versions/latest`).
    * Click "Connect", then "Save" agent settings.

5.  **Import/Configure Playbook:**
    * Import the playbook from the `ai-storyteller-agent-config` repository if you have one, or configure a new one.
    * Ensure you are working with the correct playbook (e.g., `Storyteller Playbook - GCS Test`).

6.  **Configure Playbook Instructions:**
    * Paste the playbook instructions (which define how the agent uses parameters and tool outputs to generate the story) into the "Instructions" field.

7.  **Configure Playbook Example:**
    * Edit/create an example demonstrating the successful path.
    * Tool Use step should call your Data Store Tool. Example Input JSON for the tool:
        ```json
        {
          "query": "Story about $session.params.theme with a moral of $session.params.moral",
          "filter": "",
          "userMetadata": {}
        }
        ```
    * Agent response step should contain the generative prompt, referencing user parameters (`$session.params.*`) and the tool output (e.g., `$tool.WorkspaceStoryContextTool-OneTime.snippets`). Example Prompt Text:
        ```text
        Okay, traveler! Using the inspiration found in our archives ($tool.WorkspaceStoryContextTool-OneTime.snippets), here is a new short story (300-350 words) about $session.params.protagonist in a $session.params.theme setting. The story must teach the moral '$session.params.moral'. Remember to base the story ONLY on the retrieved context from the archives, adapting creatively but not adding external information or copying verbatim. Make sure it has a beginning, middle, and end.

        Would you like me to craft another tale, traveler?
        ```
    * Configure "End example with output information". Save.

8.  **Configure Agent Generative Settings:**
    * Agent Settings -> Generative AI -> Playbook.
    * Select **Model** (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash-001`), **Temperature**, **Token Limit**. Save.

9.  **Initial Git Push (from Dialogflow CX Agent Settings):**
    * Go to Agent Settings -> Git integration. Find your connection. Click **"Push"**.

### 2.6. How to Use/Test Dialogflow CX Agent

1.  Open Dialogflow CX console, select your agent.
2.  Open the **Simulator**.
3.  Simulator settings: Environment (`Draft`), Start Resource (`Playbook`), select your specific playbook.
4.  Interact by providing protagonist, theme, and moral when prompted.

### 2.7. Known Issues / Troubleshooting Context (Dialogflow CX)

* **Webhook Parameter Preset Bug (Historical):** Initial ChromaDB/Webhook approach using parameter presets failed due to a UI bug. This led to the GCS Data Store method.
* **GCS Data Store Visibility:** "One time" sync for Data Stores was found more reliable for immediate tool linking than "Periodic" sync during development.
* **GCS Permissions:** Ensure Dialogflow Service Agent has `Storage Object Viewer` on the GCS bucket.
* **Data Store Indexing:** Can take time. Check "DATA INGESTION ACTIVITY".

## Section 3: Running the NAO Storyteller System

This section explains how to run the NAO interaction scripts and, if applicable, the local webhook for testing the end-to-end flow.

### 3.1. Configure OpenAI API Key (for `chatgpt_webhook.py`)
Ensure the `AI_STORYTELLER_TEST_KEY_CV` environment variable is set in your shell environment where `chatgpt_webhook.py` will run:
```bash
export AI_STORYTELLER_TEST_KEY_CV="sk-...your API key..."
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for persistence
```

### 3.2. Running the Components

**A. Start the Story Generation Webhook (if not using Dialogflow CX directly with NAO)**

The `test_asr.py` script for NAO is designed to call a webhook.
* **If using `chatgpt_webhook.py` for local testing:**
    This webhook generates stories using OpenAI. It's generally recommended to run modern web services and AI library interactions in a **Python 3 environment**.
    1.  Open a *new terminal*.
    2.  Activate your Python 3 virtual environment for this script (if different from the NAOqi env).
    3.  Run: `python /path/to/chatgpt_webhook.py` (ensure Flask is installed in this env).
    Keep this server running.

* **If integrating NAO with your Dialogflow CX Agent:**
    The Dialogflow CX agent *is* your "story generation service." The NAO scripts would need to be adapted to send their recognized keywords to a new webhook that, in turn, interacts with your Dialogflow CX agent's API (e.g., using the Dialogflow CX Python client library). This is a more advanced setup beyond the scope of the current `test_asr.py`. For now, `test_asr.py` uses the simpler `chatgpt_webhook.py`.

**B. Run the NAO Interaction Scripts**

Ensure your NAO robot is on, connected to the network, and you have updated the `NAO_IP` variable in the Python 2 scripts (`test_naoqi.py`, `test_tts.py`, `test_asr.py`) to match your robot's actual IP address.

1.  Open a new terminal.
2.  Navigate to your project directory: `cd /path/to/your/nao_project`
3.  Activate the Python 2 virtual environment: `source naoqi_env/bin/activate`

4.  **Verify NAO Connectivity:**
    ```bash
    python test_naoqi.py
    ```

5.  **Confirm NAO Can Speak:**
    ```bash
    python test_tts.py
    ```

6.  **Run the Full Virtual Storyteller Loop (NAO ASR -> Webhook -> NAO TTS):**
    Make sure the `chatgpt_webhook.py` (or your equivalent story generation service) is running.
    ```bash
    python test_asr.py
    ```
    Then speak one of the keywords (`hello`, `story`, `robot`) near NAO.

## Internals (NAO Interaction Scripts)

The Python 2 scripts for NAO interaction use:
- `ALSpeechRecognition` for listening.
- `ALMemory` for retrieving recognized words.
- `ALTextToSpeech` for playback.
- The `chatgpt_webhook.py` (Flask) serves `/generate_story` using OpenAI‚Äôs `chat/completions` API (model `gpt-4o-mini`).

## Future Possibilities

* **Direct NAO to Dialogflow CX Integration:** Adapt NAO scripts to interact directly with the Dialogflow CX API for a more robust conversational experience, replacing the simpler `chatgpt_webhook.py`.
* **Enhanced NAO Expressiveness:** Incorporate NAO's gestures and movements synchronized with storytelling.
* **Multi-turn Story Generation:** Leverage Dialogflow CX's capabilities for more interactive, choice-driven narratives.
* **Dynamic Vocabulary:** Allow NAO's recognized vocabulary to be updated dynamically.
* **Cloud Deployment:** Host webhooks or intermediary services on GCP Cloud Functions or Cloud Run for scalability.
