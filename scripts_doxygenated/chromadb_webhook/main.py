## @brief Google Cloud Function webhook for Dialogflow CX using Flask.
## @details This script defines a Flask application to serve as an HTTP webhook for Dialogflow CX.
##          It receives a query from Dialogflow, proxies it to a specified ChromaDB HTTP API,
##          processes the ChromaDB response, and returns a formatted fulfillment text to Dialogflow.
##          It includes error handling for API requests, timeouts, and response parsing.

# @brief Main entry point for the Google Cloud Function.
# @details This function is triggered by an HTTP request. It expects a JSON payload
#          from Dialogflow CX, extracts the user's query text, queries the
#          ChromaDB HTTP API, and formats the search results or error messages
#          into a JSON response suitable for Dialogflow's `fulfillmentText`.
# @param request flask.Request The incoming HTTP request object from Google Cloud Functions.
#        It's expected to contain a JSON payload, typically from Dialogflow CX,
#        with the user's query located at `queryResult.queryText`.
# @return flask.Response A JSON response object suitable for Dialogflow fulfillment.
#         The JSON object will have a key `fulfillmentText` containing the response string.
# @note This function handles various potential errors during its execution,
#       such as issues with the incoming payload, ChromaDB API errors (HTTP errors, timeouts),
#       and problems parsing the ChromaDB response. Error messages are user-friendly.

# Note: For Google Cloud Functions, the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block
# is not typically used for running a Flask dev server, as GCF handles invocation.
# If you were testing locally with Flask's built-in server (not GCF emulator), you would add:
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     app = Flask(__name__)
#     app.route('/', methods=['POST'])(main) # Assuming POST requests to root for local Flask dev
#     app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8080)))
# However, the provided script is a single function for GCF.
