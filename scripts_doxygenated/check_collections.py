# @brief Script to inspect a specific ChromaDB collection named "stories".
# @details This script connects to a local persistent ChromaDB instance,
#          retrieves the "stories" collection, counts the number of chunks
#          (vector embeddings), and displays a sample of their metadata.
#          This version is for the script that focuses on the "stories" collection.
