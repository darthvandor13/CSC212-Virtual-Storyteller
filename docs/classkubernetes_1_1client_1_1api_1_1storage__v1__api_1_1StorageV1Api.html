:param async_req bool: execute request asynchronously
:param str pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).
:param str _continue: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
:param int grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
:param bool ignore_store_read_error_with_cluster_breaking_potential: if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it
:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
:param bool orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \"orphan\" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
:param str propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param str resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
:param V1DeleteOptions body:
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will
                         be returned without reading/decoding response
                         data. Default is True.

This method makes a synchronous HTTP request by default. To make an
asynchronous HTTP request, please pass async_req=True
&gt;&gt;&gt; thread = api.delete_collection_csi_driver_with_http_info(async_req=True)
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = thread.get()

:param async_req bool: execute request asynchronously
:param str pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).
:param str _continue: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
:param int grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
:param bool ignore_store_read_error_with_cluster_breaking_potential: if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it
:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
:param bool orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \"orphan\" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
:param str propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param str resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
:param V1DeleteOptions body:
:param _return_http_data_only: response data without head status code
                               and headers
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will
                         be returned without reading/decoding response
                         data. Default is True.
:param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                         number provided, it will be total request
                         timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                         (connection, read) timeouts.
:return: tuple(V1Status, status_code(int), headers(HTTPHeaderDict))
         If the method is called asynchronously,
         returns the request thread.

delete collection of CSINode  # noqa: E501
This method makes a synchronous HTTP request by default. To make an
asynchronous HTTP request, please pass async_req=True
&gt;&gt;&gt; thread = api.delete_collection_csi_node(async_req=True)
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = thread.get()

:param async_req bool: execute request asynchronously
:param str pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).
:param str _continue: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
:param int grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
:param bool ignore_store_read_error_with_cluster_breaking_potential: if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it
:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
:param bool orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \"orphan\" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
:param str propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param str resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
:param V1DeleteOptions body:
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will
                         be returned without reading/decoding response
                         data. Default is True.
:param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                         number provided, it will be total request
                         timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                         (connection, read) timeouts.
:return: V1Status
         If the method is called asynchronously,
         returns the request thread.

Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
:param int grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
:param bool ignore_store_read_error_with_cluster_breaking_potential: if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it
:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
:param bool orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \"orphan\" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
:param str propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param str resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
:param V1DeleteOptions body:
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will
                         be returned without reading/decoding response
                         data. Default is True.
:param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                         number provided, it will be total request
                         timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                         (connection, read) timeouts.
:return: V1Status
         If the method is called asynchronously,
         returns the request thread.

This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
:param int grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
:param bool ignore_store_read_error_with_cluster_breaking_potential: if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it
:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
:param bool orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \"orphan\" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
:param str propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param str resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
:param V1DeleteOptions body:
:param _return_http_data_only: response data without head status code
                               and headers
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will
                         be returned without reading/decoding response
                         data. Default is True.
:param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                         number provided, it will be total request
                         timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                         (connection, read) timeouts.
:return: tuple(V1Status, status_code(int), headers(HTTPHeaderDict))
         If the method is called asynchronously,
         returns the request thread.

If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
:param bool orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \"orphan\" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
:param str propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param str resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
:param V1DeleteOptions body:
:param _return_http_data_only: response data without head status code
                               and headers
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will
                         be returned without reading/decoding response
                         data. Default is True.
:param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                         number provided, it will be total request
                         timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                         (connection, read) timeouts.
:return: tuple(V1Status, status_code(int), headers(HTTPHeaderDict))
         If the method is called asynchronously,
         returns the request thread.

This method makes a synchronous HTTP request by default. To make an
asynchronous HTTP request, please pass async_req=True

&gt;&gt;&gt; result = thread.get()

:param async_req bool: execute request asynchronously
:param str pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).
:param str _continue: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
:param int grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
:param bool ignore_store_read_error_with_cluster_breaking_potential: if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it
:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
:param V1DeleteOptions body:
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will
                         be returned without reading/decoding response
                         data. Default is True.
:param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                         number provided, it will be total request
                         timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                         (connection, read) timeouts.
:return: V1Status

         returns the request thread.

This method makes a synchronous HTTP request by default. To make an
asynchronous HTTP request, please pass async_req=True
&gt;&gt;&gt; thread = api.delete_collection_volume_attachment_with_http_info(async_req=True)
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = thread.get()

:param async_req bool: execute request asynchronously
:param str pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).
:param str _continue: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
:param int grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
:param bool ignore_store_read_error_with_cluster_breaking_potential: if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it
:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
:param bool orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \"orphan\" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
:param str propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param str resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent.

Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
:param V1DeleteOptions body:
:param _return_http_data_only: response data without head status code
                               and headers
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will

This method makes a synchronous HTTP request by default. To make an
asynchronous HTTP request, please pass async_req=True
&gt;&gt;&gt; thread = api.delete_volume_attachment(name, async_req=True)
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = thread.get()

:param async_req bool: execute request asynchronously
:param str name: name of the VolumeAttachment (required)
:param str pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).
:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
:param int grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
:param bool ignore_store_read_error_with_cluster_breaking_potential: if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING: This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is false, and the user must opt in to enable it
:param bool orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \"orphan\" finalizer will be added to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
:param str propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents; 'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

:param str _continue: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent.

Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param str resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
:param bool watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

                         data. Default is True.
:param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                         number provided, it will be total request
                         timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of

This method makes a synchronous HTTP request by default. To make an
asynchronous HTTP request, please pass async_req=True
&gt;&gt;&gt; thread = api.list_csi_storage_capacity_for_all_namespaces_with_http_info(async_req=True)
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = thread.get()

:param async_req bool: execute request asynchronously
:param bool allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type \"BOOKMARK\". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
:param str _continue: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
:param str pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).
:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param str resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
:param bool watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
:param _return_http_data_only: response data without head status code
                               and headers
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will
                         be returned without reading/decoding response
                         data. Default is True.
:param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                         number provided, it will be total request
                         timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                         (connection, read) timeouts.
:return: tuple(V1CSIStorageCapacityList, status_code(int), headers(HTTPHeaderDict))
         If the method is called asynchronously,
         returns the request thread.

This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param str resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
:param bool watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
:param _return_http_data_only: response data without head status code
                               and headers
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will
                         be returned without reading/decoding response
                         data. Default is True.
:param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                         number provided, it will be total request
                         timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                         (connection, read) timeouts.
:return: tuple(V1CSIStorageCapacityList, status_code(int), headers(HTTPHeaderDict))

:param str pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).
:param bool allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type \"BOOKMARK\". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
:param str _continue: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".

:param async_req bool: execute request asynchronously
:param str pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).
:param bool allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type \"BOOKMARK\". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
:param str _continue: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param str resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
:param bool watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
:param _return_http_data_only: response data without head status code
                               and headers
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will
                         be returned without reading/decoding response
                         data. Default is True.
:param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                         number provided, it will be total request
                         timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                         (connection, read) timeouts.
:return: tuple(V1StorageClassList, status_code(int), headers(HTTPHeaderDict))

list or watch objects of kind VolumeAttachment  # noqa: E501
This method makes a synchronous HTTP request by default. To make an
asynchronous HTTP request, please pass async_req=True
&gt;&gt;&gt; thread = api.list_volume_attachment_with_http_info(async_req=True)
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = thread.get()

:param async_req bool: execute request asynchronously
:param str pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).
:param bool allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type \"BOOKMARK\". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
:param str _continue: The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
:param str field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
:param str label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
:param int limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
:param str resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param str resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
:param bool send_initial_events: `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \"Bookmark\" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
:param int timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
:param bool watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
:param _return_http_data_only: response data without head status code
                               and headers
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will
                         be returned without reading/decoding response
                         data. Default is True.
:param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                         number provided, it will be total request
                         timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                         (connection, read) timeouts.
:return: tuple(V1VolumeAttachmentList, status_code(int), headers(HTTPHeaderDict))
         If the method is called asynchronously,
         returns the request thread.

:param async_req bool: execute request asynchronously
:param str name: name of the CSIDriver (required)
:param object body: (required)
:param str pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).
:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
:param str field_manager: fieldManager is a name associated with the actor or entity that is making these changes. The value must be less than or 128 characters long, and only contain printable characters, as defined by https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsPrint. This field is required for apply requests (application/apply-patch) but optional for non-apply patch types (JsonPatch, MergePatch, StrategicMergePatch).
:param str field_validation: fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
:param bool force: Force is going to \"force\" Apply requests. It means user will re-acquire conflicting fields owned by other people. Force flag must be unset for non-apply patch requests.
:param _return_http_data_only: response data without head status code
                               and headers
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will
                         be returned without reading/decoding response
                         data. Default is True.
:param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                         number provided, it will be total request
                         timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                         (connection, read) timeouts.
:return: tuple(V1CSIDriver, status_code(int), headers(HTTPHeaderDict))

:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
:param str field_manager: fieldManager is a name associated with the actor or entity that is making these changes. The value must be less than or 128 characters long, and only contain printable characters, as defined by https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsPrint. This field is required for apply requests (application/apply-patch) but optional for non-apply patch types (JsonPatch, MergePatch, StrategicMergePatch).
:param str field_validation: fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
:param bool force: Force is going to \"force\" Apply requests. It means user will re-acquire conflicting fields owned by other people. Force flag must be unset for non-apply patch requests.
:param _return_http_data_only: response data without head status code
                               and headers
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will
                         be returned without reading/decoding response
                         data. Default is True.
:param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                         number provided, it will be total request
                         timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                         (connection, read) timeouts.
:return: tuple(V1CSINode, status_code(int), headers(HTTPHeaderDict))
         If the method is called asynchronously,
         returns the request thread.

Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
:param bool force: Force is going to \"force\" Apply requests. It means user will re-acquire conflicting fields owned by other people. Force flag must be unset for non-apply patch requests.
:param _return_http_data_only: response data without head status code
                               and headers
:param _preload_content: if False, the urllib3.HTTPResponse object will
                         be returned without reading/decoding response
                         data. Default is True.
:param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                         number provided, it will be total request
                         timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                         (connection, read) timeouts.
:return: tuple(V1VolumeAttachment, status_code(int), headers(HTTPHeaderDict))
         If the method is called asynchronously,
         returns the request thread.

:param str pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed. Defaults to 'false' unless the user-agent indicates a browser or command-line HTTP tool (curl and wget).
:param str dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
:param str field_manager: fieldManager is a name associated with the actor or entity that is making these changes. The value must be less than or 128 characters long, and only contain printable characters, as defined by https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsPrint.

This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
