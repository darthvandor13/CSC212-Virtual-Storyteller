If you returned an object                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have                    that `password`.                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,                    so it's an error from the API developer.

If you returned an object                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have                    that `password`.                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,                    so it's an error from the API developer.

If you returned an object                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have                    that `password`.                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,                    so it's an error from the API developer.

If you returned an object                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have                    that `password`.                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,                    so it's an error from the API developer.

It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to                be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,                etc.                It will be used for:                * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will                    show it as the response (JSON Schema).                * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the                    `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the                    corresponding JSON.                * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data                    (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have                    that `password`.                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,                    so it's an error from the API developer.

If you returned an object                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have                    that `password`.                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,                    so it's an error from the API developer.

If you returned an object                    that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does                    not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have                    that `password`.                * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the                    `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the                    corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not                    valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,                    so it's an error from the API developer.
